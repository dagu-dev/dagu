"DAGU is a powerful Cron alternative that comes with a Web UI. It allows "
"you to define dependencies between commands as a `Directed Acyclic Graph "
"(DAG) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph>`_ in a "
"declarative :ref:`YAML Format`. Additionally, DAGU natively supports "
"running Docker containers, making HTTP requests, and executing commands "
"over SSH. DAGU was designed to be easy to use, self-contained, and "
"require no coding, making it ideal for small projects."
